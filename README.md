# Bioinformatics Mini-Projects and Exercises

This repository contains a collection of bioinformatics mini-projects and exercises aimed at enhancing my mathematical and coding skills in various relevant fields. Each project focuses on different aspects of computational biology, machine learning, and data analysis.

## Projects

### 1. **Mouse Ortholog Finder Script**
A script to identify mouse orthologs, exploring data parsing and biological databases.

### 2. **Predicting Coefficients of a Polynomial**
- **Implemented two approaches**: linear regression and an analytical method using the Vandermonde matrix.
- **Key highlight**: A comparison of these methods demonstrates mathematical insights into polynomial fitting.

### 3. **Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling with PyMC**
- **Focused on Bayesian modeling** using a chain of three distributions.
- Explored probabilistic reasoning with the **PyMC library**.

### 4. **t-SNE Algorithm from Scratch**
- Recreated the **t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)** algorithm to learn its mathematical foundations.
- While slower than optimized libraries, this implementation deepened my understanding of the **original t-SNE paper**.
- Also tested **t-SNE from scikit-learn** to compare clustering performance.

### 5. **Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for Nanopore Sequencing Signals**
- Built an **HMM to parse nanopore sequencing signals** using GaussianHMM from the `hmmlearn` module.
- Also implemented the **forward-backward algorithm from scratch** to better understand the HMM principles.
